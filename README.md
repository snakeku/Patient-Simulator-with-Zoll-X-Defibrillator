# Patient-Simulator-with-Zoll-X-Defibrillator
**I am developing a realistic defibrillator simulation for Paramedic Students to practise their clinical reasoning skills. The app provides realistic simulation test with sound effects, ECG monitoring, heart rate, blood pressure, and more. Different scenarios will be created based on human physiological conditions that will expand the paramedicâ€™s knowledge and aptitude in a variety of settings. In addition, this app provides worldwide access to e-learning and skill development instead of relying on practical sessions alone to increase paramedic competencies. This is made possible using Flutter and Firebase.**
